Nothing 2 crazy.
Background Information.
--> Which "significant" features of Angular I used.
- routing. forms. services. TS. higher order functions. lifecycle components. data binding. directives.


Improvements (time sacrifices):
- Overall styling. Cleaner cards and list groups.
- Small bugs.
  - whne a guy has multiple roles that has multiple permissions. duplicates show up too.
  - CSV only gets the first role and first permission.
